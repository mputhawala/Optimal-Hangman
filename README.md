# Optimal-Hangman

This program is meant to showcase a strategy for playing the children's game hangman which is surprisingly good, and pleasingly mathematically elegant.

The C++ code is stand alone. You need a dictionary file in order to run this program. An example dictionary is included, but there is nothing special about that particular dictionary, it's just the first one that I could easily find.
